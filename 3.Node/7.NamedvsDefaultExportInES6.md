## Named Export: (export)

- With named exports, one can have multiple named exports per file. 
- Then import the specific exports they want surrounded in braces. 
- The name of imported module has to be the same as the name of the exported module.

## Default Export: (export default)

- One can have only one default export per file. When we import we have to specify a name and import like:

``` 
import MyDefaultComponent from "./MyDefaultExport";
const MyComponent = () => {}
export default MyComponent;

```
- The naming of import is completely independent in default export and we can use any name we like.

**A default export can be a function, a class, an object or anything else. This value is to be considered as the “main” exported value since it will be the simplest to import**
