# Module Pattern of NodeJs

> In lang. like Java, it's easy to do multifile programming using import

- The module pattern is a design pattern in JavaScript that allows you to **create encapsulated pieces of code** that can be reused and distributed without exposing their internal implementation details to the outside world.

1. Common js modules (cmj) - require 
2. ES modules - import
