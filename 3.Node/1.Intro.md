- Libraries intends to do one very simple task, and multiple libraries can be combined in a package and that will be a framework. Eg-Ruby on Rails is a frame.

- Node is neither a framework nor a language.
__Node is a runtime envirnment for JS__

> When HTML is rendered in a browser, It is rendered in the form a DOM tree - Document object model tree.

> Node opened a lot of OS based feature for JS, 
1. like accessing file system
2. Accessess to the processes
3. Opened options of streams

Now due to this, Frameworks like express, Sails, using which now we can prepare server side logic using JS
