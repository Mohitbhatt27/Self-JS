- The main task of Package Manager is Dependency Resolutions.

- Dependency Resolution is the process of finding the right version of a package that satisfies the version constraints specified in the package.json file.

_In simple terms, your one package may depend on another package. And that package may depend on another package. And so on. This is called a dependency tree._

_The package manager will look at the dependency tree and find the right version of each package that satisfies the version constraints specified in the package.json file._
