# Determining Module System

### ES modules
Node.js will treat the following as ES modules when passed to node as the initial input, or when referenced by import statements or import() expressions:

1. Files with an .mjs extension.

2. Files with a .js extension when the nearest parent package.json file contains a top-level "type" field with a value of "module".

3. Strings passed in as an argument to --eval, or piped to node via STDIN, with the flag --input-type=module.


### CommonJS

Node.js will treat the following as CommonJS when passed to node as the initial input, or when referenced by import statements, import() expressions, or require() expressions:

1. Files with a .cjs extension.

2. Files with a .js extension when the nearest parent package.json file contains a top-level field "type" with a value of "commonjs".

3. Strings passed in as an argument to --eval or --print, or piped to node via STDIN, with the flag --input-type=commonjs.
