### Streams

- Streams are a way to read and write data in a sequential manner. Streams are used to read and write data in chunks. 

- Our terminal is also a stream. We can read and write data to it.

- Using process.stdout we can get access to the standard output stream. We can write data to it using process.stdout.write().

- Using process.stdin we can get access to the standard input stream. We can read data from it using process.stdin.on('data', (data) => { console.log(data) })
