### Packages Managers

 - Packages in JS are the folders that contains package.json file. When we create a library, and then we ship it to npm, we are actually creating a package.
 
 - We depend on already written libraries. In Ruby these libraries are called gems. In JS these libraries are called packages.
  
 - We can install packages using npm. Npm is a package manager. It is a tool that allows us to install packages. For example in python we have pip, in Ruby we have gem, in JS we have npm.
  
 - *For node we have 2 famous package managers: npm and yarn. Npm is the default package manager for node. Yarn is a new package manager that is faster than npm.*

 **These package managers manages installation of packages, their dependencies, versioning, publishing, etc.**

*NPX is a package runner. It allows us to run packages without installing them. It is a tool that allows us to run packages without installing them. For example, if we want to run a package called create-react-app, we can do so by running npx create-react-app my-app. This will create a new react app in a folder called my-app.*
