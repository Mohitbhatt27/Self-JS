### API

- API stands for Application Programming Interface.

- Let's say that there is a developer X and he has prepared a mailing service. Now he wants that other developers can consume his service. So he will provide a set of functions that other developers can use to send mails. This set of functions is called API.

- API is a set of functions that are provided by a developer to other developers to use his service.

- Dev-X exposes a contract where we will be given information about how to call the mailing service, what input we need to give, and what output we will get. This contract is called API.
