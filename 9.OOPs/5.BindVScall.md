### Bind vs call

- *Bind actually returns a completely new function, on which 'this' is bounded to the argument that we have given to bind.*

- *Call will immediately call the same function, with the object binded to 'this' context.*

- Bind is used when we want to create a new function, which can be called later.

- Call is used when we want to call the function immediately.
