# Async/Await

- Async/ Await is used to handle promises in synchronous code fashion with less code effort.
- Async: We put this keyword before any function then, it will return a promise.
- Await: This keyword is used before a promise inside the Async block to block the code until promise resolves or reject.
- So, these keyword helps us to get write a synchronous fashion code with cleaner syntax.

_The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains_


- if you declare a func async, it does the following:

1. It allows the use of await keyword
2. if you declare a function a sync, it allows consumption of a promise using awaits
3. **async function always converts your return value to a promise**

*async function declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope and can be called anywhere in their scope.*
