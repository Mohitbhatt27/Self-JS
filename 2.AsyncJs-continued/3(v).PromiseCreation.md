## Creating a promise 

-> to create a promise call the promise constructor.

-> the promise constructor takes a *callback as an argument*, which is mandatory. This callback is called *executor function*

-> the callback passed inside constructor, *take 2 arguments resolve and reject*

-> then inside the executor callback, we will write our logic

-> if you want to return something on success, then call resolve function with whatever value you want to return

## Creation of a promise object is synchronous.
