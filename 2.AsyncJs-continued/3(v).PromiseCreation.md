## Creating a promise 

-> to create a promise call the promise constructor
-> the promise constructor takes a *callback as an argument*.
-> the callback passed inside constructor, *take 2 arguments resolve and reject*
-> then inside the callback, write your logic
-> if you want to return something on success, then call resolve function with whatever value you want to return

## Creation of a promise object is synchronous.
