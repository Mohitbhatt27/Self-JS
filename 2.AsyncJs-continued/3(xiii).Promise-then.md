# Now technically, when promise gets resolved , we have to execute some functions

- we can use .then() function on the promise object , to mend the functions we want to execute once we fulfill a promise
- The .then() function takes function as an argument that we want execute after promise fulfills, and the argument function takes value property as parameter
- the .then function itself returns a new promises
