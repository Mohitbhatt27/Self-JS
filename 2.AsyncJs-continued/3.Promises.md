### Promises

_Promises are special JS objects_
- They are also considered _readability enhancers_
- They get immediately returned from a function that is setup to return a promise
- They _act as placeholders for the data we hope to get back from some future task_

- We also attach the functionality we want to defer until the future task is done.
- Promise automatically handle execution of this functionality.



So promises do two things , one inside JS & one outside. 
1. **It signs up the process required to run in the runtime & gives a placeholder in JS, which has a value property**
