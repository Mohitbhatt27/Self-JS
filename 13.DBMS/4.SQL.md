### SQL - intro

**SQL stands for Structured Query Language. Structured query language is a language used to communicate with a database.**

- SQL is a declarative language. It means that we don't need to tell the computer how to do something, we just need to tell it what we want to do.

- SQL is a standard language. It means that SQL commands can be used to access data in all major databases.

**MySQL is not SQL. SQL is a language, MySQL is technically a software. MySQL may not support all the features of SQL**
