### ORM

ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping.

These are libraries that helps us to do database queries but instead of writing sql syntax, we write object oriented syntax.

### For express along with node, we use Sequelize.

### Sequelize

Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.
