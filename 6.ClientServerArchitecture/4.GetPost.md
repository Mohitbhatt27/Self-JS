### Get and Post difference

- In get request, data is send in URL, which means it gets saved in browser history. We can log it, cache it, bookmark it, etc. So, it is not secure.

- In post requests, generally data is not expected to be sent in URL, rather than request body/payload. So, it doesn't get saved in browser history.
