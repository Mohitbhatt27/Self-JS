### Monolith and Microservices

- Monolith is an architecture to build projects where every service that you have give to the end user is written in the same code base.

The problem with this is that, if you have to make a change to one service, you have to make changes to the entire code base.

Later, concepts of microservices came into the picture.

- Microservices isolate every different service all together, there will a different server running for authetication, for payment, for user management, for product management, for order management, etc.

Maintaience of microservices is a lot easier than monolith. Scaling is also easier.
