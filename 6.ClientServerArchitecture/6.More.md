### JSON

- In rest convention, we always use JSON to send and receive data (apart from URL).


***Let's say I want to write REST API for a blog, then**

- To create a blog post: Type of request should be POST, URL should be /blog.


- Request body: Data should be in JSON format.
{
    "title": "My first blog post",
    "content": "This is my first blog post"
}

- Response should be in JSON format.
{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "My first blog post",
    "content": "This is my first blog post"
}
