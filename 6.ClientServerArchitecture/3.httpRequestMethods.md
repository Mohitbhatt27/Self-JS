### http request methods

The most common ones are:
1. GET
2. POST
3. PUT
4. DELETE
5. PATCH

# In Rest convention,
- GET is used to retrieve information about the resource.
- DELETE is used to delete a resource.
- PATCH is used to make partial update to a resource.
- POST is used to create side effects on a resource.
- PUT makes a full update to a resource.

- *The following http requests are supported by HTML:* get and post. 
- Now, if HTML doesnt support other http requests, then how do we use them? Let's say if we have to delete a user, then we have to use the delete http request. But HTML doesnt support delete. So JavaScript comes to the rescue. We can use JavaScript to send delete requests to the server.
