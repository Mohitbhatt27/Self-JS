# Convention used for setting up APIs

### 1. REST
### 2. SOAP
### 3. GRPC

- Rest stands for Representational State Transfer. Rules of rests:

1. **Every real life entity is expected to be represented as a resource.**
2. Everytime with a restful API request, we have to send type (methods) of the request.

3. There is going to be a unique URL for every resource.
