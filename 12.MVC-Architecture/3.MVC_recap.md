### MVC RECAP

1. The user makes a request from the view(menu) which uses a route, such as /profile.

2. The controller(waiter) then receives this request and provides instructions on what to do. These orders can either go to the model where it performs certain logic, or it could go to the view and possibly update or serve a specific page.

3. If it goes to the model, then it carries out the logic, pulls from a database and sends back a consistent response based on the controllerâ€™s instructions.
