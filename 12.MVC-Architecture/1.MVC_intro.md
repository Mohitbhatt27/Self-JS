### MVC

- The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a tried and true form of building modern day web applications. 
- We encounter this pattern in a number of frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Django, or Angular and it has allowed developers the ability to organize code in a way that separates files based on the job they do. 

- *This is a principle of web development called “separation of concerns” and it’s based around creating files with specific jobs and having them interact in a very defined way.* 
Here’s what it looks like:

1. Model: Structures your data in a reliable form and prepares it based on controller’s instructions

2. View: Displays data to user in easy-to-understand format, based on the user’s actions

3. Controller: Takes in user commands, sends commands to the model for data updates, sends instructions to view to update interface.
