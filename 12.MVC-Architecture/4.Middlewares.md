### Middlewares

- *Middleware is a function that has access to the request object, and the response object, and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.*

- Suppose a user made an API call, that Api call is going to hit the backend. When it hits the backend, we are going to have routes written in our backend.

- We are going to segregate the routes. 

- *We can pass the request to the set of middlewares. Every middleware has access to the request object, response object and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.*

- We can have multiple middlewares.

- Let's say a user has send some data to the backend. We can have a middleware that can validate the data. If the data is valid, we can pass it to the next middleware. If the data is invalid, we can send a response back to the user.

- *Last Middleware calls the controller*

```js
app.get('/route', middleware1, middleware2, middleware3, (req, res) => {
    // controller
})
```
- app.use() is used to setup the middleware.
